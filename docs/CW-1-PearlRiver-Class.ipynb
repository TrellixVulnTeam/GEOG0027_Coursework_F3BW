    "Your task in this section is to calculate the area of land cover & land use (LULC) extent (in $m^2$) for each year of a series of Landsat imagery, along with an associated characterization of uncertainty in each of these areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we need to quantify **at least three types** (urban, agricultural, and natural) of land uses for each given year. A number of classification methods have been taught in this module, and Maximum Likelihood is a good starting point for multispectral TM imagery. There are also other image processing methods could help to identify land use classes (e.g. vegetation indices, filters, segmentation, etc.). Then, we can identify where changes have happened and how much land area has been transformed into urban built.  See example land use change map below from [Seto et al. 2002](http://www.unc.edu/courses/2008spring/geog/577/001/www/Seto02-IJRS.pdf)."

You should also show the associated mask files in your report.\n",

We mention this to allow you to more easily seperate which parts of the work should go into which section: all details and descriptions of the classifications, up to the point of producing a set of classified images and an appropriate dataset for validation must go into the `Methods` section (this is to do with allocation of marks, as much as anything else).\n",

You should also report the number or proportion of pixels of each class, plotted as a function of year and present any other results you feel appropriate. Do *not* present many graphs that essentially show the same thing (unless indicated in these instructions), though you may include some in appendices (not simply to reduce the word count though)."

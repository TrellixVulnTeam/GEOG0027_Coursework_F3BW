    "### Using `R` or `Rstudio`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways you can develop and run the modelling code we will be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the `R` software that you should be familiar with for the first year. If you need to refresh you memory with what you did in [GEOG0013, we provide the relevant files for you on moodle](https://moodle-1819.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2712#section-4). Try to make sure you are familiar with loading `csv` files, basic graphing, and performing linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which option should I choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is probably easiest for you to use the `RStudio` environment for this work. First, this should be what you are familiar with. Second, it is convenient to use to develop codes and save the results as a report. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the UCL Geography computers, we don't have `Rstudio`, only `R`. You should be able to use this, but it doesn't give you the fancy interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The options for software environments for doing this part of the work are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `R` on the Geography UCL (Linux) computers\n",
    "2. Run `Rstudio` using Windows on [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere)\n",
    "3. Run `Rstudio` (or `R`) on your own computer\n",
    "4. Run `Rstudio` on binder\n",
    "5. Run `R` (via Python) on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using option 1. is that you don't need to do anything other than come along and use the computers in the Geography Unix lab. Whilst there are ways you can access this remotely, it is perhaps not the easiest thing for you to do so, so if you intend working outside of the lab a lot, then consider another option. Also, you don't have access to `RStudio` in this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options 2-4 would probably be the best for you to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "Option 5 is very neat, and involves running the codes in a notebook (this is a notebook you are using now!). But it is more complex to explain how to do this. If you are particularly interested in this sort of computing, we will help individuals to go through this route on request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3 needs you to set up software. Options 2 and 3 need you to install data and code files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4 has everything set up for you, runs in any browser (so, even on your phone or tablet), on an external server, *but* you are at risk of losing your work if you let the session go idle for 10 minutes or more, or if your session lasts longer than 12 hours. You can of course save and reload your work, but you have to be more careful of this in option 4. Also, option 4 takes a few minutes to get started, as it has to run a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing R and Rstudio on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3 involves setting up `R` and `Rstudio` on your own computer, so follow the instructions below for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the packages you need for `R` and `RStudio`, follow the links below to download and install the software. Check it works by starting `RStudio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and install R from https://cran.rstudio.com\n",
    "* Download and install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing data packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Options 2 and 3 need you to install some data and software packages. This involves downloading the file \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Start RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/profLewis/GEOG0027_Coursework.git/master?filepath=docs/2021_UrbanModel.ipynb?urlpath=rstudio)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 5\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to use option 5 is to start this page in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/profLewis/GEOG0027_Coursework.git/master/?filepath=docs/2021_UrbanModel.ipynb)"
